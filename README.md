## About the project

Our platform,​ the agricultural database management system ​ is to keep tracking records
of various aspects of farming and trading. In order to maintain yields and meet the food
demands of a growing population parallelly protecting natural resources, we need to make
a few changes, database management can determine a lot. Intuitive decision making plays
a key role in farming, database management systems provide insights to make the right
decisions possible. This stored information helps farmers to identify efficiencies that lead to
higher productivity and profit.
Data helps farmers eliminate volatility and risk which is beneficial not just to the grower but
also to the supplier. So the supplier is more convenient to work with that farmer on a
long-term basis. At the same time, the data allows the producer to work with the supply
chain to help companies and retailers increase the transparency of their ingredients. This
process is helping farmers to get financial assistance from the bank and co-operative
societies. In the marketing process of various agricultural products, they can also get
assistance with this agricultural database system. Government officials like MRO’s or
farmers can understand how farming is going on and the methods followed by other
farmers in different places. Also, it is easy for the farmer to analyze their crop values.
Government sectors are also getting helped with this type of database system for providing
various schemes like​ Kisan Yojana, Raithu Barossa​ . Helps to estimate the cropping pattern ofthe particular local area. We can use this database system for marketing communications
with the market to sell the crop by staying in the home itself.
